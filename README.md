This is a clone of the AirBnb project.
We start with building the frontend which consists of a console as our interface with the following commands:
    1. create - creates classes eg User, city, Review
    2. read - reads data from storage engine
    3. update - update instance of classes of a given id
    4. delete - delete/destroy class
    5. count - gives us the number of instances
    6. All - displays info about all classes
    7. EOF - shows/signals end of program
    8. show - gives information of class id
    9. quit - exits out of the program
